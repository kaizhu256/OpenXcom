UFO: ENEMY UNKNOWN V1.2
=======================

The following additions and changes have been made to the game since 
the manual was written. We hope these improvements will enhance game 
play.

SOUND

1. If you wish to change the sound configuration, after initial 
installation, run the setup program in your UFO directory.

MEMORY

Due to the game's size and complexity you may experience difficulties 
while playing on a machine with only 2 MB of RAM.

1. If your game fails to load, remove EMM386 from your CONFIG.SYS.  
UFO runs in protected mode so it does not require an expanded memory 
driver.

2. If you do not get sound effects for certain events from your 
Gravis or Soundblaster card, this is due to a lack of available RAM. 
This could be caused by superfluous TSR (terminate and stay resident) 
programs in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  Remove these TSR 
programs and all sound will play correctly.
